Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my website â€” a mix of **portfolio** and **blog**, built to share what I'm working on, what Iâ€™m learning, and what I find interesting in the world of tech.

Iâ€™ve always wanted a little space on the internet that feels mine. Somewhere I can write freely, showcase my projects, and maybe connect with a few curious minds along the way.  
This is that space.


## What to Expect

Starting today, Iâ€™ll be posting **at least one blog per week**.  
The topics will revolve around:

- Tech I'm currently exploring
- Coding ideas, tips, and side projects
- Thoughts on tools, frameworks, and products
- Personal experiences in software development

If youâ€™re into any of that â€” stick around!  
Hopefully, some of this content will inspire or help you on your journey too.


## Inspiration

A big thank you to [ChanhDai](https://chanhdai.com/) â€” I took heavy inspiration from his clean design, layout, and writing style while building this site.  
His work reminded me that simplicity can be powerful.

That's it for now.

More soon.
