I’m currently working on a backend project using **NestJS**, so I thought I’d share a quick overview of what it is and how to get started with it — especially if you’re used to working with Express or similar frameworks.

---

## What is NestJS?

[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is a **progressive Node.js framework** for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It uses **TypeScript by default** and combines elements from:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Functional Programming (FP)**
- **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**

If you’ve ever worked with Angular, you’ll feel right at home — NestJS follows a similar modular and decorator-based architecture.

## Why use NestJS?

- **Built-in TypeScript support**
- **Powerful CLI** for generating boilerplate
- **Modular architecture** (split your app into reusable modules)
- Integrates well with **Express**, **Fastify**, **GraphQL**, **WebSockets**, and more
- Great for **microservices** and **monoliths**

## Installation

To get started with NestJS, install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

Then create a new project:

```bash
nest new my-nest-project
```

To run your app:

```bash
npm run start
```
