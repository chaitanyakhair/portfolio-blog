## Why Website Speed Matters

In today’s fast-paced digital world, **speed isn’t just nice to have — it’s essential**.  
A slow website can frustrate visitors, increase bounce rates, and even harm your search engine rankings.

> A 1-second delay in page load time can lead to a **7% drop in conversions**.

## Key Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Minimize HTTP Requests**
Each image, script, and CSS file is an additional request. Reduce the number by:
- Combining CSS and JS files
- Using image sprites
- Removing unused assets

```javascript
// Example: Combining two scripts into one
import './main.js';
import './analytics.js';
// Instead of loading them separately
```

### 2. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
A CDN stores your website’s static assets on servers worldwide, delivering them from the closest location to the user.
Popular CDNs:

- Cloudflare
- Akamai
- Amazon CloudFront

### **3. Optimize Images**
Images are often the largest files on a page. You can:

- Use WebP or AVIF formats
- Compress with tools like TinyPNG
- Implement lazy loading

```html
<img src="image.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Optimized Image" />
```

### **4. Enable Browser Caching**
Set cache headers so that browsers store static files locally.

```apache
# Example for Apache
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresByType image/webp "access plus 1 year"
</IfModule>
```

### **5. Minify & Compress Files**
Minify HTML, CSS, and JS, and enable Gzip or Brotli compression on your server.

### **6. Reduce Render-Blocking Resources**
Defer non-critical JavaScript and load CSS asynchronously.

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

### **7. Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)**
Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js help render content faster for users and search engines.
